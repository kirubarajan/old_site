            I'm an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania enrolled in the Artificial Intelligence
            dual degree program, studying computer science and cognitive science (linguistics).
            Read <a href="/blog">my blog</a> or reach me at <strong>kiruba@cis.upenn.edu</strong>. <br> <br> 
            
            This summer I will be researching natural language processing at Penn, using deep learning to improve
            dialogue agents under Professor Chris Callison-Burch. Last year, I worked on cloud infastructure
            for self-driving cars at an autonomous driving startup named Trackgen. <br> <br>

            In addition to machine learning, I also like web development in ES6 JavaScript and Python 
            (this site was written in Flask). As a software engineer at <a href="https://pennlabs.org">Penn Labs</a>, I work on
            our public API as well as the PennSDK to help our developers create apps that over ten thousand students use. <br> <br>

            Lately, I've been trying to make computer science education and software engineering more approachable through 
            <a href="https://beta.elore.io">elore</a>, the open source education platform I co-founded at MIT. <br> <br>

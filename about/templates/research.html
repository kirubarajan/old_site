          <h1 class="title"> my research</h1>
          <p> I am an undergraduate researcher working in Professor <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/">Chris Callison-Burch's</a> lab. My research interests
            include applying deep learning techniques to natural language processing problems, specifically in the domain of information extraction and dialogue systems. 
            I have publications in the ACL anthology, NAACL and the SPIE Defence Journal.<br> <br>

            In 2016, I published a conference paper in the 2016 SPIE Defense journal and presented a talk on the cloud architecture I helped design (online
            processing of autonomous vehicle sensor data). This architecture was later developed at Trackgen and deployed into production.<br> <br>

            I've previously volunteered at McMaster University under Professor Jamal Deen and Dr. Thamarasa, assisting
            in data analysis using D3.js and Javascript. In addition, I helped write scripts to speed up instantiation of EC2 instances
            for analyzing tracker data. <br> <br>
